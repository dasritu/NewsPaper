    <p>Using public Wi-Fi can easily be a victim of cyber attacks. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team has issued a warning. Cert has warned that the tendency to be victims of cyber attacks due to the use of public Wi-Fi at airports or railway stations is 'high' (extreme). Cert says that through public Wi-Fi, hackers can easily steal confidential information such as credit card numbers, passwords, emails, chat messages. As a result, the user can be in danger. Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS and Windows users are most likely to fall prey to these cyber predators. Cert is therefore advising the use of VPN (virtual private network) instead of public Wi-Fi to avoid danger.</p>
